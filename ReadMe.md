## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a "living" dictionary - one in which anyone with an email address can add their own definition. Currently, the only open dictionaries that I can find require extensive review from editors. This dictionary will allow users to submit definitions for any word, from any language, and without any review whatsoever. The interface will be similar to reddit, where users will be able to upvote or downvote definitions. Also like reddit, users will be free to create sub-dictionaries, which can then be moderated. 
These subdictionaries are infinitely divisible into further sub-dictionaries, in the same way that classes are infinitely divisible into further sub-classes in object-oriented programming. For instance, one might have dictionary *Elementary-level reading English dictionary*, which is a subdictionary of *English Dictionary - profanity free*, which is a subdictionary of *English Dictionary*... so on and so forth, one gets the idea.  

## Sub-dictionaries
Of course, there must be some logical structure to our sub-dictionaries. The structure should be efficient and minimalist in design to optimize scalability, as the infinite divisibility of sub-dictionaries is a key component to this system.
